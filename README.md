# Spring Boot Quickstart Project

The project is not yet complete, there will be a LOT of changes and force pushes for now.  
Instructions on setting up the project for yourself will be written when it's moderately complete.

## What is this?
This is a sample project made with IndustryStandardsâ„¢ unironically.  
It has all the basic stuff you'll need for bootstrapping most projects you want to create, with minimum hassle.  
It's also great for school projects and such when you want to flex with proper project structure for no reason.  

## How to use
You'll need a server, a mysql database, and more depending on the modules you'd like to use.
